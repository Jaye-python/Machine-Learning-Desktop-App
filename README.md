# Machine-Learning-Desktop-App
This Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning App cleans your imported data; it encodes, removes outliers, scales, removes null values, removes duplicate values, does feature selection, builds your X and y models, executes 4 major Machine Learning Algorithms, and saves your preferred algorithm using joblib (model persistence) and finally predicts your data using your saved algorithm; all in one sitting! In the video, we predict price range of mobile phones based on their specs; the data used was downloaded from Kaggle. Predict business, health, economic, market, and financial variables 10x faster (actually in 10 minutes!) with this software.
